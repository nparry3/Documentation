# Introduction
Trust is hard. It always has been and always will be. How do you trust your neighbour. Your friends, spouce, employer, and employee? Each of us has our threshhold. Each has our own weights, measurements, tipping point, and 'feeling'. Its not something we can put our finger on easily. Its even harder to define and quantify.

In short, we cannot solve the holistic spectum of trust, within the platform, by simply relying on one algorythm. In effect, many different forms of trust architectures are required to achieve the goals set by the RelateID team. In the following document we will explore trust and how it will manifest itself within the RelateID platform. The components, and separate architectures of the trust platform are:

1. Transactional: The BlockChain
2. One-to-one: This is the trust of an indivdual towards another individual
3. Community: The trust of an individual within a community
4. Organizational: This is the trust mechanics for conducting commerce and services on the platform
5. Governance: Higher level structures that ensure integrety within various commerce areas
6. Platform Growth: This is the structure which is more about continuously improving the RelateID platform well into the future without the original founders involvement.

Note that, in its current form, this document does not set out to completely define these trusts and their associated architecture. Instead, it seeks to identify them in order to get the conversation started. As time goes on, and more people get involved, we aim that this document continues to grow and improve as new ideas are formed and shaped into the trust architecture.

Due to the fact that trust is quiticential to the platforms success, are hope is that people from all disiplines and walks of life begin to participate in the discussion. Ideally, as the community grows, SIG's (Special Interest Groups) will begin to form provide narrow focus into factors of the architecture.

# Before We Begin
Fraud happens... its a fact of life. Bad people are out there seeking out an angle every second of every day. They are intelligent, patient, sofisticated, organized and motivated. We cannot ignore them because they will not ignore us. Their intent is to pray on the weak while seeking to distract the strong. They do not care about our goals and ambitions. They do not feel bad. Their concious is clean and their heart is cold. Since the dawn of time they have existed and they will exist until the last star goes flutters and dies. They are preditors. They are killers and thieves. They will not stop. So neither must we. 

So, instead of presuming that we can stop these fraudsters and charletons, lets all collectively agree that they exist, as a fundamental rule of the trust platform, in order to be ready to address for this inevitable reality. 

The prolem we face, if we think that, out of the gate, we will forsee every attach vector, is that we run the risk of trying to 'harden' the platform to such a degree that fraud is impossible, two negative outcomes will arise:

1. The system will be to ridged and 'honest' users of the system will be de-motivated to use it due to its complexity and 'fuzzy' requirements. We need to ensure to have a simple system that is easy to understand for the majority of the planet whom are seeking to simply do the right thing.
2. We will be wrong and fraud will still happen... because, as we stated above, its a fact of life. Someone somewhere will find a way. The always do, so lets not kid ourselves.

The above may be a hard truth for some to accept, however, not being honest about this reality, and burrying our heads in the sand, will simply result in a system designed to fail. By accepting this truth, we will set the standard to be forever vigilent. We will go into this with an approach of caution and an approach of personal responsibility. As fraud happens and is detected, we will get beter at solving it. We will be more reactive as well as proactive. Groups will form to monitor the network and vigilantly protect it. The platform will grow and will be better because of it.

# And Another Thing
We cannot solve all the responsibilities of trust with one algorythm or system. Its way to complicated. As we will see below, the blockchain has solved the trust of transactions within the architecture, however, this stratgy cannot be applied to every type of trust required by the system. In fact, it is likely that every layer of trust will require diffent mechanics, and tooling to accomplish its goals.

To make the obvious more obvious simply observe your own unique life. You may trust someone to sell you a coke, but you would not trust them with your bank account. You may ( or may not ) trust the government with your information and management of your county/state/countries infrustructure but would not entrust a use car salesmen with the same responsibility. You trust the police for things. 

To be fair, if you are like me, the trust for many of the above examples has petered off and you feel like the choices being made are not your own. Lets not quible over that here... it really is not the place. I am just tryning to make a point. In reality I have genuine trust for a select few. I am forced into trusting others (police, banks, senators, etc) and do not like it. But lets not muddy the waters. Lets focus because honestly, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it in. Trust me.

# Layers Of Trust
This section will provide a high level vision for the various components within the trust architecture. It does not go into detail as details will be provided in subsiquent documentation and discuussion.

## Transactional Trust
The blockchain solves the issues of trust for us in order to guarentee transactions between two trustless parties. This is the core of the system and what it set out to solve. It is revolutionary in its application and will forever change the way in which humans transact over the interweb. However, before moving one, lets define this trust. 

Many claim that the blockchain is a completely distrubuted, anonomous network of trustless parties being able to conduct transactions on the web. This is true and we are not disputing it. Going further, many declare that no central control or authority exists within the network which is what democrotizes it. We also agree with this. However, there is an ever lingering proverbial 'elephant in the room' that we rairly, if ever address... The blockchain relies, and in fact could not function without, a centralized algorythm. Its not a big thing, but it is important we can all agree on this before moving onto the other aspects of the system. The claim that the blockchain has not centralized authority or control is wrong. The algorthym is centralized and controlled. We are not suggesting, in any way, that we need to change this. It is a core tenant of the blockchain and what makes it work. Its just important to recognize.

I bring this up because each additional layer of trust within the network also requires its own 'centralized' authority and control in the form of an algorythm. These algorythms will be independant of each other, yet reliant on one another. In contrast to the blockchains algorythm, some, if not all, will also require human intervention and involvement in order to function.

Going further, once Dapps begin to evolve on the network, additional facets of trust, unforseen at this time, will need to be desegned and developed in order to attract users to the Dapp. Our intent, as RelateID is to provide the framework for the underpinnings of the platforms trust mechanics without getting in the way of these Dapp developers in the future.

## Trusting Each Other
The basic foundation of the platform is individuals vouching (trusting) other individuals on the network. In fact, this is the base form for all trust on the network. Without attaining this root level of trust, other levels of trust cannot be achieved. A few things about trust in order to baseline:
1. Trust is given.
2. Trust is in one direction only. Just because you trust someone does not infer that they trust you back.
3. Trust can be revoked.
4. The trust you give is the composition of the trust you have been given

Just a not before going on... the math on all this still needs to be done. If you like math and would like to work on this problem with us, please let us know.

Lets get Real for a second. In order to attain 'Realness' on the network, indivisuals will first need to be trusted by others on the network. Individuals are not considered real, or able to conduct commerce on the network, until they are considered real.

Once and individual is real, a one time generation of tokens is performed. However, these tokens are not given to the new 'real' individual but are instead granted to the individuals who trusted them before the event. Note that:
1. You cannot recieve tokens until you are real on the network.
2. Once real you can never become unreal. If you lose your trust you can get it back, however, a generation of tokens does not again occur.

To be fair, we will require more rules here but we are looking towards the communities involvement in defining it. Looking at it in its current form it is open for fraudulent activilty in which individuals would be able to create fake accounts to mine coins and do nothing with them. This would force the network into being essentially useless and noone would be able to trust it. I'm sure other attack vectors will show themselves over time as well.
