# The What

It should to be easier. Building your idea needs to be simple. What you build it on must be flexible and unbound. The experience should be like plugging in a lamp. Simple, intuitive, standardized, secure, and reliable.

In many ways, the blockchain community has solved a lot of these problems already. It has certainly solved the logistics around building a distributed ledger. In addition to this, the community developed the concept of smart contracts in order to provide flexibility in transactions and how to manage them.

With the above in place, the community must now turn its attention to building capabilities that enable commerce and considerably ‘lower the bar of entry’, in order to entice entrepreneurs towards crypto-currency. The ‘Relateid Community Platform (RCP)’, presented below, is our strategy to do just that.

The RCP will support commercialization opportunities for engineers and datacenter operators. Our platform provides the infrustructure for entrepreneurs to create new services that 'plug-into' the ecosystem easily and convinently. This sets the platform up for mass interoperability between services providing the ability to create amorphous collection of services for entrepreneurs.

The output from the technologists are then be available for purchase within the ecosystem. Entrepreneurs will be have a simple ‘drag and drop’ interface to purchase these services. The services themselves, although independent, bind together, through a common interface to create a service mess. From here a million use cases can be born.

Imagine setting up a small business in minutes. Everything wired configured and running. Timesheet, SSO, fraud detection, CRM, CMS, digital advertising, kanban boards, secure chats, etc. You agree to the consolidated billing… And then you go run your business.

Imagine selling to business in minutes. The RCP supports services outside of its core platform. In this way, existing vendors will be able to maintain their current way of operations, while still monetizing on the RCP.

In the end, the RCP is conceptualized to make business easier for everyone. The crypto-currency math adds up. No need to disrupt its focus by introducing use cases around commerce. The RCP platform solves that. It adheres to the rules of, and communicates with, the blockchain. However, from the perspective of users, it just works. Coins are transferred. Business is done.

# The Why

The Relateid Application Platform (RAP) is a true sandbox for commerce enabled through blockchain technology. RAP enables a broad spectrum of technologies with plug-and-play capabilities. These capabilities are what differentiates it from other platforms on the market today. Two elements sit at the core of the Relateid platform. These elements enable opportunities through the use of block chain and platform plug-n-play technologies. Combined these features lower the bar of entry to the blockchain, the enterprise, commerce, and consumers.

At the highest level of abstraction, RAP consists of three distinct components. These components are blockchain (transactional management), state-channels (community) and datacenters (commerce). By separating these components RAP distinguishes itself from other platforms. Other platforms are trying to solve the integration of services by using the same platform and solutions it used to solve the blockchain. This causes undue complexity forced into the blockchain which results in,

Forced engagement paradigms on businesses,
Limited tooling operationally,
Implementation complexity,
Limited reuse of the broader communities toolings and techniques outside the blockchain community,
High-bar for enterprise integration,
High-bar for development,
High-bar for every-day people.
Conversely RAP innovation factors enable,

Flexible and sensitive to business paradigms
Familiar tooling for users making it intuitive to adopt
Individuals and Enterprises can leverage existing technologies and skill sets
Peer-to-peer functionality
Lower-bar for enterprise integration,
Lower-bar for development,
Lower-bar for every-day people.

# Break It Down: The 3C's

This section intends to provide a high level abstract on the boundaries between layers of the RAP. Note that these abstracts are system wide components and, as a result, extend outside the goals of this whitepaper. Please see the [Relateid Whitepapers](Home) for more information on blockchain and state-channels.

The three main components of RAP are:


| Component      | Function        | Tool             |
| -------------- |:---------------:| :---------------:|
| Blockchain     | Currency        | BigChainDB       |
| Blockchain     | Data Assets     | BigChainDB       |
| State-Channels | Community       | Lightning/Raiden |
| State-Channels | Communications  | Lightning/Raiden |
| Datacenters    | Commerce        | Kubernetes       |

## Blockchain & Currency

Our blockchain provides the core functions on the management of currency. The blockchain does not, and should not, concern itself with user management or any higher level service that have no direct impact on currency management. With this in mind, our blockchain will be constrained to: 

* transactional security,
* inflation management,
* trustless ledger consensus,
* and the execution of smart contracts. 

By constraining the blockchain component, we define its areas of responsibility, thereby minimizing its scope. With this, the blockchain component remains focused on intent, while providing commerce the ability to expand in a natural manor.

## State-Channels & Community

State-Channels are designed to manage the trust networks that are required in order for commerce to thrive in a decentralized, and trustless, economy. In essence, you can think of state-channels (community) as the glue between the blockchain (currency) and datacenters (commerce).

## Datacenters & Commerce

The datacenter component provides the mechanics and integration protocols for businesses who want leverage crypto currency without the need to become experts. The datacenter enables individuals and companies to continue working with common development technologies and processes they are familiar with to access the power of the block chain (currency) and state-channels (community). 

## Summing Up

The blockchain, state-channel, and datacenters components, establish a clear separation between the management of the currency, the management of the community, and the management of commerce. This structure provide the abstractions required for everyone to participate in extending value within the RAP ecosystems. Individuals and organizations will participate in a fashion they are familiar with. 

We believe that business should be unfettered in how it conducts itself. Having these abstractions facilitates this goal.
